<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxv. Correctness Of Conduct (Modestia), That Is, The Desire Of Pleasing Men Which Is Determined By Reason, Is Attributable To Piety (As We Said In Iv. Xxxvii. Note. I.). But, If It Spring From Emotion, It Is Ambition, Or The Desire Whereby, Men, Under The False Cloak Of Piety, Generally Stir Up Discords And Seditions. For He Who Desires To Aid His Fellows Either In Word Or In Deed, So That They May Together Enjoy The Highest Good, He, I Say, Will Before All Things Strive To Win Them Over With Love: Not To Draw Them Into Admiration, So That A System May Be Called After His Name, Nor To Give Any Cause For Envy. Further, In His Conversation He Will Shrink From Talking Of Men's Faults, And Will Be Careful To Speak But Sparingly Of Human Infirmity: But He Will Dwell At Length On Human Virtue Or Power, And The Way Whereby It May Be Perfected. Thus Will Men Be Stirred Not By Fear, Nor By Aversion, But Only By The Emotion Of Joy, To Endeavour, So Far As In Them Lies, To Live In Obedience To Reason.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
