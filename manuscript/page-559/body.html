However, To Give Aid To Every Poor Man Is Far Beyond The Power And The Advantage Of Any Private Person. For The Riches Of Any Private Person Are Wholly Inadequate To Meet Such A Call. Again, An Individual Man's Resources Of Character Are Too Limited For Him To Be Able To Make All Men His Friends. Hence Providing For The Poor Is A Duty, Which Falls On The State As A Whole, And Has Regard Only To The General Advantage.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
