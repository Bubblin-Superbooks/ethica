But Human Power Is Extremely Limited, And Is Infinitely Surpassed By The Power Of External Causes; We Have Not, Therefore, An Absolute Power Of Shaping To Our Use Those Things Which Are Without Us. Nevertheless, We Shall Bear With An Equal Mind All That Happens To Us In Contravention To The Claims Of Our Own Advantage, So Long As We Are Conscious, That We Have Done Our Duty, And That The Power Which We Possess Is Not Sufficient To Enable Us To Protect Ourselves Completely; Remembering That We Are A Part Of Universal Nature, And That We Follow Her Order. If We Have A Clear And Distinct Understanding Of This, That Part Of Our Nature Which Is Defined By Intelligence, In Other Words The Better Part Of Ourselves, Will Assuredly Acquiesce In What Befalls Us, And In Such Acquiescence Will Endeavour To Persist. For, In So Far As We Are Intelligent Beings, We Cannot Desire Anything Save That Which Is Necessary, Nor Yield Absolute Acquiescence To Anything, Save To That Which Is True: Wherefore, In So Far As We Have A Right Understanding Of These Things, The Endeavour Of The Better Part Of Ourselves Is In Harmony With The Order Of Nature As A Whole.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
