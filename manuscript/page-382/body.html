Shame Is Pain Accompanied By The Idea Of Some Action Of Our Own, Which We Believe To Be Blamed By Others.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Explanationâ€”On this subject see the note to III. xxx. But we should here remark the difference which exists between shame and modesty. Shame is the pain following the deed whereof we are ashamed. Modesty is the fear or dread of shame, which restrains a man from committing a base action. Modesty is usually opposed to shamelessness, but the latter is not an emotion, as I will duly show; however, the names of the emotions (as I have remarked already) have regard rather to their exercise than to their nature.</p></div> </div>
