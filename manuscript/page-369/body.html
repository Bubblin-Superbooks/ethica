Disparagement Is Thinking Too Meanly Of Anyone Because We Hate Him.</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Explanationâ€”Thus partiality is an effect of love, and disparagement an effect of hatred: so that partiality may also be defined as love, in so far as it induces a man to think too highly of a beloved object. Contrariwise, disparagement may be defined as hatred, in so far as it induces a man to think too meanly of a hated object. Cf. III. xxvi. note.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
