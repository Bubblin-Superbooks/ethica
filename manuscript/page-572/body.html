As, Therefore, Those Things Are Good Which Assist The Various Parts Of The Body, And Enable Them To Perform Their Functions; And As Pleasure Consists In An Increase Of, Or Aid To, Man's Power, In So Far As He Is Composed Of Mind And Body; It Follows That All Those Things Which Bring Pleasure Are Good.
