For Men Are Diverse (Seeing That Those Who Live Under The Guidance Of Reason Are Few), Yet Are They Generally Envious And More Prone To Revenge Than To Sympathy. No Small Force Of Character Is Therefore Required To Take Everyone As He Is, And To Restrain One's Self From Imitating The Emotions Of Others. But Those Who Carp At Mankind, And Are More Skilled In Railing At Vice Than In Instilling Virtue, And Who Break Rather Than Strengthen Men's Dispositions, Are Hurtful Both To Themselves And Others. Thus Many From Too Great Impatience Of Spirit, Or From Misguided Religious Zeal, Have Preferred To Live Among Brutes Rather Than Among Men; As Boys Or Youths, Who Cannot Peaceably Endure The Chidings Of Their Parents, Will Enlist As Soldiers And Choose The Hardships Of War And The Despotic Discipline In Preference To The Comforts Of Home And The Admonitions Of Their Father: Suffering Any Burden To Be Put Upon Them, So Long As They May Spite Their Parents.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
