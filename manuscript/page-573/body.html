<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxxi. Superstition, On The Other Hand, Seems To Account As Good All That Brings Pain, And As Bad All That Brings Pleasure. However, As We Said Above (Iv. Xlv. Note), None But The Envious Take Delight In My Infirmity And Trouble. For The Greater The Pleasure Whereby We Are Affected, The Greater Is The Perfection Whereto We Pass, And Consequently The More Do We Partake Of The Divine Nature: No Pleasure Can Ever Be Evil, Which Is Regulated By A True Regard For Our Advantage. But Contrariwise He, Who Is Led By Fear And Does Good Only To Avoid Evil, Is Not Guided By Reason.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
